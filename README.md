Here is my XML project for the final evaluation. 
For the first step, we must be able to provide an XML file linked to a DTD file. We must also write a .readme file presenting the works we have chosen  to encode, and explain why we chose them.
As for me, since I love poetry, I chose to work on three French poems from the 19th and 20th centuries that I particularly like: *Le Lac* by Alphonse de Lamartine, *L'Albatros* by Charles Baudelaire, and *La courbe de tes yeux* by Paul Eluard. I had studied them in the past and found their structure interesting, both in terms of meaning (highlighted in XML) and form. 
*Le Lac* is a poem from 1820, published in *Méditations poétiques*. It is known as one of the most famous poems of French Romantic poetry, alongside the poems of Victor Hugo, and presents a reflection on time. 
*L'Albatros* is a poem from 1859, published in the collection *Les Fleurs du Mal*. Focusing on the theme of travel, the poem reflects Baudelaire's taste for the exotic. 
*La courbe de tes yeux* is a poem from 1924, published in the collection *Capitale de la douleur*. This poem follows the classical model of the blazon, inspired by Clément Marot in the 16th century, and consists of a eulogy to an anatomical part of the beloved. 


The use of XML as a markup format focused primarily on the meaning of the text rather than its layout is very interesting, especially in poetry. That is why I chose poetry because the objective of the exercise will be to edit the text using XML. This allows the literary work to be structured semantically. 
I did not use AI except for translation tools in order to write in more fluent English.
